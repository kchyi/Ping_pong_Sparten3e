This project is a ping-pong game on Sparten 3e development board. game is controled by on-board buttons and a P/S2 keyboard. Game video is output via onboard VGA port to a VGA monitor. 

project consists two parts, hardware and software. Hardware platform is build using Xilinx embedded hardware configuration software. Most of the hardware moduels are added from IPs in the software. The VGA module is written by me using VHDL. VHDL code included.

software is written in C code. Software is constructed using QP-nano statemachine.
